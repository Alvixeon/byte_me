# byte_me
get it, funny joke. 
Anyway it literally just opens a file as a new file, erasing all the data and putting it to 0 bytes.

The only point of this file is so that I can "Corrupt" files.

byte_me.eat(path) <- this one just eats one file.

byte_me.gorge(abs_dir) <- this one eats all the files. (In a specific directory that is)
